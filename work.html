                <h2>Space Shooter</h2>
                <p>A game similar to space invaders. 
                    Same concept of having enemies come down from the top of the screen and having the player
                shoot and dodge attacks trying to get a high score.</p>
                <p>Was an interesting project trying to figure out how to code shooting along with hit registration.
                    The hitboxes for the enemy ships caused the most issues since when trying to get them to move
                    it would constantly cause crashes and it was finally fixed when i made the hitboxes reset every frame.

                <h2>LC3 Calculator</h2>
                <p>A calculator made on the LC3 capable of continuously adding extremely large numbers.</p>
                <p>This was interesting to try and figure out and the way i ended up doing it is have one input 
                    saved in the memory and treated almost like an array. The second input was then treated like a stack
                    and the second input was then added to the first going from the smallest digit to the highest untill the program
                    reached the end of the second input.
