      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! </p>
      <p>My name is Nick a computer science student at NIC.</p>
      <p>I became interested in programming once i took a computer science class back in highschool.
        I then decided to take computer science in college and I enjoy it quite a bit.
      </p>
      <p>I plan on using what i learn to go into game development.
        Usually people think that design is where the fun part is for game development, while design is fun
        I think finding and fixing bugs can be just as fun, anyone whos played some buggy games has probably seen this, 
        plus programming is how everything comes together.
